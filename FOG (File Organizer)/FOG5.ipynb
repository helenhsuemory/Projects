    "# FOG5 (File Organizer V.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "FOG5 is an advanced file organizer that helps you keep your computer organized and efficient. It offers a range of powerful features to help you manage your files, including the ability to detect and delete duplicated files and rename PDF files based on their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key benefits of using FOG5 is its ability to scan your specified directory and identify any duplicated files. These files can take up valuable space on your computer, slowing it down and making it harder to find the files you need. FOG5 makes it easy to locate and delete these duplicates, freeing up valuable space and improving the performance of your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to deleting duplicates, FOG5 also provides a convenient way to rename PDF files based on the title of the document. This can be especially useful if you have a large number of PDF files with generic or unclear names, making it difficult to find the file you need. By using the title of the PDF as the file name, FOG5 helps you keep your PDF files organized and easy to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, FOG5 is an essential tool for anyone looking to improve the organization and efficiency of their computer. Whether you're a professional or a casual user, FOG5 can help you keep your files organized and make it easier to find the documents you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use FOG5, run the code below and enter the directory path in which you want to clean the duplicated files and rename the pdf files based on the title of the document. "
